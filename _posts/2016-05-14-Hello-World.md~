Welcome to my first blog post! I've set this blog up to follow my experiences as I participate in [Google Summer of Code 2016](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/), but hopefully I can make it generally interesting to anyone who happens to stumble their way here.

I'm participating in GoSC under the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/), working with [MDAnalysis](http://www.mdanalysis.org/). A huge thanks to all three for giving me this opportunity!

MDAnalysis is a Python library for analysing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. I'll be working on introducing capabilities to deal with the particular set of MD simulations associated with a method known as Umbrella Sampling (US).

If, like my feline friend here, none of that makes any sense to you; fear not! I'll explain more about the background and details of MD, US and my project in an impending future post. For now, here's a bit more about myself:

I'm currently doing a PhD in Biochemistry at the University of Oxford.

My work involves use of MD simulations, including the US simulations that are the focus of my GoSC project, to study binding of peripheral proteins to cell membranes. _(Shameless self-promotion: you can check out my first paper [here](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpclett.6b00153)!)_

I did my undergraduate degree, majoring in biochemistry and physics, at the University of Sydney (in-between wrestling crocodiles and drop bears, of course). I grew up in Australia, though I'm originally a (proud) Kiwi.

In my free time I enjoy reading, baking, knitting and other crafts. I already have some ideas for some GoSC project-themed creations, so stay tuned for those!

Well, that's all from me for now. I'll be back - with that promised project explanation - soon!
